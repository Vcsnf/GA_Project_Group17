# GA_Project_Group17

This is the project for the course Genome Analysis of Helen, Tika, Josse and Victor. We were not able to knit the markdown files because of conflicting versions of the rlang package, so we provided the markdown files themselves.

This repository contains:
- A README file
- Two markdown files: one for the microarray analysis, another one for the RNA-seq analysis
- The QC reports of the RNA-seq analysis
